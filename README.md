¹ Uses [WorkManager][workmanager] with foreground service notifications for
reliable background downloads with resumable support via HTTP `Range` headers.
See [Android Support](#android-support) for details.

² Supports fully interruptible and resumable background downloads, even when
the app is suspended or terminated using
[`URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession)
with a background configuration. See
[iOS Support](#ios-support) for details.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install NPM dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the TypeScript bindings:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Build the Rust plugin:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

### Tests

Run Rust tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

Run Swift tests (iOS download manager library):

```bash
swift test --package-path ios/DownloadManagerKit
```

Run Kotlin tests (Android download manager library):

```bash
cd android && ./gradlew :lib:test
```

## Install

_This plugin requires a Rust version of at least **1.94.0**_

### Rust

Add the plugin to your `Cargo.toml`:

`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-download = { git = "https://github.com/silvermine/tauri-plugin-download" }
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript

Install the JavaScript bindings:

```sh
npm install @silvermine/tauri-plugin-download
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Initialize the plugin in your `tauri::Builder`:

```rust
fn main() {
   tauri::Builder::default()
      .plugin(tauri_plugin_download::init())
      .run(tauri::generate_context!())
      .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

### Configuration

Use `Builder` instead of `init()` to configure the plugin. `init()` is shorthand for
`Builder::new().build()`.

#### Builder options

| Method | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `user_agent` | `impl Into<String>` | None | `User-Agent` sent with every download request |
| `on_setup` | `FnOnce(&AppHandle, &mut SetupConfig) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>` | None | Hook for settings that need the app instance |

#### Setup options

Set inside `on_setup`, which runs once the app exists and `app.path()` is available:

| Method | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `store_dir` | `impl Into<PathBuf>` | Platform-specific | Directory holding `downloads.json` |

Full example:

```rust
use tauri::Manager;

fn main() {
   tauri::Builder::default()
      .plugin(
         tauri_plugin_download::Builder::new()
            .user_agent("my-app/1.0")
            .on_setup(|app, config| {
               config.store_dir(app.path().app_data_dir()?.join("downloads"));
               Ok(())
            })
            .build(),
      )
      .run(tauri::generate_context!())
      .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

#### Platform defaults

Both settings are opt-in. Left unset, each platform keeps its own:

| Platform | Store location | User agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop | `app_data_dir()/downloads.json` | none |
| Android | `filesDir/downloads.json` | `okhttp/<version>` |
| iOS | `Application Support/downloads.json` | `<app>/<version> CFNetwork/… Darwin/…` |

Key behaviors:

   * **The store is not migrated.** Changing `store_dir`, or adopting it for the first
     time, leaves any old records where they are, invisible to the plugin — treat it as
     discarding the download history
   * `store_dir` must be absolute, and on mobile inside the app sandbox; a relative path
     fails plugin initialization
   * **Keep `store_dir` on internal storage on Android.** The store lists every
     download's URL and local path, so on external or shared storage it is readable by
     any app holding storage access on pre-scoped-storage devices. The default,
     `filesDir`, is app-private
   * The directory need not exist — iOS creates a configured one during plugin
     initialization, everything else on the first write
   * A configured directory that cannot be created fails plugin initialization on iOS,
     rather than leaving every write to fail into a log line the caller never sees
   * Returning `Err` from `on_setup` aborts startup
   * `user_agent` must be printable ASCII or horizontal tab, the rule all three HTTP
     stacks share; anything else fails plugin initialization
   * An empty `user_agent` is accepted and sends an empty header rather than none
   * A download resumed after a relaunch uses the new run's user agent on desktop and
     Android; iOS keeps the value the download started with when it resumes from resume
     data


### API

#### List downloads

```ts
import { list } from 'tauri-plugin-download';

async function listDownloads() {
   const downloads = await list();

   for (const download of downloads) {
      const totalBytes = download.totalBytes ?? 'unknown';

      console.debug(
         `Found '${download.path}': [${download.status}, ${download.receivedBytes}/${totalBytes} bytes, ${download.progress}%]`
      );
   }
}
```

#### Get a download

```ts
import { get, DownloadStatus } from 'tauri-plugin-download';

async function getDownload() {
   const download = await get('/path/to/file.zip');

   if (download.status === DownloadStatus.Pending) {
      console.debug(`Download '${download.path}' not found in store`);
   } else {
      const totalBytes = download.totalBytes ?? 'unknown';

      console.debug(
         `Found '${download.path}': [${download.status}, ${download.receivedBytes}/${totalBytes} bytes, ${download.progress}%]`
      );
   }
}
```

#### Create, start, pause, resume or cancel a download

The API uses discriminated unions with type guards for compile-time safety.
Only valid methods are available based on the download's status.

```ts
import { get, DownloadStatus, hasAction, DownloadAction } from 'tauri-plugin-download';

async function createAndStartDownload() {
   const download = await get('/path/to/file.zip');

   if (download.status === DownloadStatus.Pending) {
      // Download not in store - create it first
      const { download: created } = await download.create('https://example.com/file.zip');
      await created.start();
   }
}

async function manageDownload() {
   const download = await get('/path/to/file.zip');

   if (hasAction(download, DownloadAction.Start)) {
      await download.start(); // TypeScript knows start() is available
   } else if (hasAction(download, DownloadAction.Pause)) {
      await download.pause(); // TypeScript knows pause() is available
   } else if (hasAction(download, DownloadAction.Resume)) {
      await download.resume(); // TypeScript knows resume() is available
   }
}
```

A download can be restricted to unmetered, unconstrained networks when it is created:

```ts
const download = await get('/path/to/large-file.zip');

if (download.status === DownloadStatus.Pending) {
   const { download: created } = await download.create(
      'https://example.com/large-file.zip',
      { allowMetered: false }
   );

   await created.start();
}
```

`allowMetered` defaults to `true`. When it is `false`, the download is confined to
connections the platform reports as unmetered — no cellular, no personal hotspot.
Desktop and iOS also exclude constrained connections (Low Data Mode on iOS); Android
has no equivalent, so there the option maps to WorkManager's unmetered constraint
alone.

Only mobile has an OS scheduler to defer to, so desktop refuses where mobile waits:

| | No eligible network at `start()`/`resume()` | Network stops qualifying mid-transfer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop | Rejects; the download stays `Idle` or `Paused` to retry later. | Keeps running. |
| iOS | Resolves, status `InProgress`; the background `URLSession` task waits, transferring nothing. | Stalls, then continues on its own. |
| Android | Resolves, status `InProgress`; WorkManager holds the work request. | Stalls, then continues on its own — see below. |

Recovery needs no call from you on either platform, but they differ. iOS leaves the task
alone and it continues when a network satisfies it. Android's worker cannot survive the
connection going away, so WorkManager retries it on the same constraint, resuming from
the partial file — expect it to lag by the backoff delay rather than restarting the
moment the network qualifies.

Android can also report `Paused` mid-hold: if the constraint tracker stops the worker
before the connection drops — the two race — the retry moves it back to `InProgress`. A
record merely waiting, on the unmetered constraint or in a retry backoff, stays
`InProgress` with no worker running; restart the app then and the plugin reconciles it to
`Paused`, or `Idle` at zero bytes when no partial file survives, before the pending work
moves it back. Reconciliation emits no event, so the stale value arrives through the next
`get()` or `list()`.

So treat `Paused` and `Idle` as "not currently transferring" rather than "waiting for the
user", and drive recovery off events. No bytes are lost either way. Constraint holds are
not time-limited; transient errors are. A download gives up after at most five retries —
fewer if constraint interruptions have spent part of the same budget — then needs
`resume()`, or `start()` if it reconciled to `Idle`.

> Resuming an iOS download goes through `downloadTask(withResumeData:)`, which takes no
> request, so the policy is inherited from the original task rather than reapplied. That
> it survives is confirmed on device, but Apple does not document resume data as carrying
> request properties — worth re-checking against new iOS releases.

The network policy is fixed when the download is first created. Every download state
exposes its resolved policy through `download.options.allowMetered`. Calling `create()`
again for an existing path returns the existing record without changing its URL or
options.

#### Listen for progress notifications

Listeners can be attached to downloads in any status, including `Pending`, so they can
be set up before the download is created. Each download state includes `receivedBytes`,
`totalBytes`, and `progress`. When the server does not provide a content length,
`totalBytes` is `null`; `progress` remains `0` until the terminal `Completed` event,
where it is `100`.

```ts
import { get, DownloadStatus } from 'tauri-plugin-download';

async function setupAndStartDownload() {
   const download = await get('/path/to/file.zip');

   // Attach listener (works for Pending downloads too)
   const unlisten = await download.listen((updated) => {
      console.debug(
         `'${updated.path}': ${updated.receivedBytes}/${updated.totalBytes ?? 'unknown'} bytes (${updated.progress}%)`
      );
   });

   // Create and start if pending
   if (download.status === DownloadStatus.Pending) {
      const { download: created } = await download.create('https://example.com/file.zip');
      await created.start();
   }

   // To stop listening
   unlisten();
}
```

Alternatively, pass `{ autoUnlisten: true }` to automatically remove the listener
when the download reaches a terminal state (`Completed` or `Canceled`):

```ts
await download.listen((updated) => {
   console.debug(`'${updated.path}': ${updated.progress}%`);
}, { autoUnlisten: true });
```

### Examples

Check out the [examples/tauri-app](examples/tauri-app) directory for a working example of
how to use this plugin.

### Testing with mocks

For unit tests, this package publishes `@silvermine/tauri-plugin-download/mocks` so you
can keep using the real JavaScript API while mocking the Tauri backend.

This helper is designed for tests that need to:

   * Seed one or more downloads before the test runs
   * Exercise `get()`, `list()`, and download actions without a real Tauri app
   * Emit download change events for listener tests
   * Inject command errors for failure scenarios

The mock helper approximates backend/native state transitions for common test flows.
It is not a backend contract and does not transition downloads to `Completed`.
Use `emitChange()` to simulate progress updates or terminal-state events, or
`setDownload()` to seed a specific state without emitting an event.
It only simulates the desktop event path and returns `false` for `is_native`,
so tests for the native/mobile listener branch need a separate approach.

`createMockDownloadState()` computes `progress` from `receivedBytes` and
`totalBytes` when `progress` is not explicitly provided. For unknown-size
downloads, use `totalBytes: null`. A generated `Completed` state reports
`progress: 100`.

```ts
import { afterEach, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import {
   DownloadAction,
   DownloadStatus,
   get,
   hasAction,
} from '@silvermine/tauri-plugin-download';
import {
   clearDownloadMocks,
   createMockDownloadState,
   mockDownloadPlugin,
} from '@silvermine/tauri-plugin-download/mocks';

afterEach(() => {
   clearDownloadMocks();
});

it('starts a mocked download', async () => {
   mockDownloadPlugin({
      downloads: [
         createMockDownloadState(DownloadStatus.Idle, {
            path: '/tmp/file.zip',
         }),
      ],
   });

   const download = await get('/tmp/file.zip');

   if (hasAction(download, DownloadAction.Start)) {
      const response = await download.start();

      expect(response.download.status).toBe(DownloadStatus.InProgress);
   }
});
```

## Android Support

On Android, this plugin uses a pure Kotlin download manager library (`:lib` module)
backed by [WorkManager][workmanager] with `CoroutineWorker` for reliable background
execution.

[workmanager]: https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/persistent/getting-started

### How It Works

1. **App Running**: Downloads run as foreground services with notifications,
   with real-time progress updates
2. **App Backgrounded**: `WorkManager` ensures downloads continue reliably
3. **Resumable**: Supports HTTP `Range` headers for resuming interrupted
   downloads
4. **App Resumed**: The plugin reconciles state and emits completion events

### Manifest Declarations

Downloads run in a foreground service, which Android 14 (API 34) requires an app to
declare. The plugin declares it in its own manifest and the manifest merger folds it
into the app, so **there is nothing to add to
`gen/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**. What the merge adds:

| Declaration | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` | The transfer itself |
| `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | `WorkManager` runs each download as a foreground service so it survives the app being backgrounded |
| `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` | The typed permission API 34 requires for a `dataSync` service |
| `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | The ongoing progress notification a foreground service must show |
| `<service android:name="androidx.work.impl.foreground.SystemForegroundService" android:foregroundServiceType="dataSync" />` | `WorkManager`'s own service, typed for API 34 |

`WorkManager` adds `WAKE_LOCK`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` and `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`. To
see what an app ships:

```sh
cd src-tauri/gen/android && ./gradlew :app:processDebugMainManifest
cat app/build/intermediates/merged_manifest/*Debug/*/AndroidManifest.xml
```

#### Notification permission

`POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is a runtime permission on Android 13 (API 33) and later, and the
plugin does not request it. Downloads run either way; the progress notification appears
only once the app requests it and the user grants it.

#### Merge conflicts

If the app or another dependency declares `SystemForegroundService` with a different
`android:foregroundServiceType`, the merge fails. Declare the service in the app manifest
with every type it needs and let it win:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
    <application>
        <service
            android:name="androidx.work.impl.foreground.SystemForegroundService"
            android:foregroundServiceType="dataSync|location"
            android:exported="false"
            tools:replace="android:foregroundServiceType" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

The list must still include `dataSync`, and each type needs its matching
`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_*` permission.

#### Opting out of the foreground service

To ship without the foreground service permissions — and without the Play declaration
below — remove them in the app manifest, which needs
`xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"` on its `<manifest>` element:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"
    tools:node="remove" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC"
    tools:node="remove" />
```

Downloads still run: the worker logs the failed promotion and continues as ordinary
background work. Expect the system to stop it soon after the app leaves the foreground,
and `WorkManager` to resume it later.

### Google Play Console

An app that ships `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC` and targets API 34 or later must
[declare that use][play-fgs] before it can roll out. In Play Console: **Monitor and
improve → App content → Foreground service permissions**.

   1. Select the **Data sync** type — the one this plugin uses
   2. Describe the feature: user-started file downloads that keep transferring while the
      app is backgrounded
   3. Say what happens if the system defers or interrupts the download — a required part
      of the declaration, not the same question as step 2
   4. Link a video showing the download continuing, not just the download UI
   5. Submit — it is reviewed, and an incomplete declaration blocks a rollout

[play-fgs]: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821

The declaration belongs to the app rather than to a release, so revisit it only when the
set of foreground service types changes.

**Note**: an app _targeting_ API 35 or higher gets [a six-hour cap][fgs-timeout] on
`dataSync` foreground service runtime per 24 hours — it follows the target SDK, not the
device, so targeting 34 avoids it on an Android 15 phone. Bringing the app to the
foreground resets the budget; long transfers are resumed rather than run in one stretch.

[fgs-timeout]: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15

### Project Structure

The `android/` directory is a 3-module Gradle build:

   * **Root module** (`:`): The Tauri plugin bridge (`DownloadPlugin.kt`), depends on
     `:lib` and `:tauri-android`
   * **`:lib` module**: Pure download manager library (`org.silvermine.downloadmanager`),
     no Tauri dependencies, independently buildable and testable
   * **`:example` module**: Standalone example app (Compose UI), depends only on `:lib`

### Running the Example App

Open the `android/` directory in Android Studio, select the `:example` run configuration,
and run on an emulator or device.

### Testing the Network Policy

No SIM needed. Mark the Wi-Fi network as metered from its settings page — Network &
internet on stock Android, Connections on One UI — where the option reads "Treat as
metered". The example app's "Allow metered networks" toggle sets `allowMetered` on the
downloads it creates.

With the toggle off, a download holds at zero bytes until the network is marked
unmetered. Marking it metered mid-transfer stalls the download; it continues by itself
a backoff delay later.

## iOS Support

On iOS, this plugin uses `URLSession` with a background configuration, so downloads
continue even when the app is suspended or terminated by the system.

### How It Works

1. **App Running**: Downloads proceed normally with real-time progress updates
2. **App Suspended**: iOS continues downloads in the background
3. **App Terminated**: iOS completes downloads and relaunches the app in the background
   to deliver results
4. **App Resumed**: The plugin reconciles state and emits completion events

### Running the Example App

Open `ios/DownloadManagerExample/DownloadManagerExample.xcodeproj` in Xcode,
select a simulator or device, and run.

### Testing the Network Policy

No SIM needed, but a real device is — Low Data Mode cannot be set on a simulator.
Toggle it under Settings → Wi-Fi → the ⓘ beside your network → Low Data Mode, which
trips `allowsConstrainedNetworkAccess`. The example app's "Allow metered networks"
toggle sets `allowMetered` on the downloads it creates.

With the toggle off, a download holds at zero bytes until Low Data Mode is off.
Turning it on mid-transfer stalls the download without leaving `inProgress`; it
continues by itself once off again.

Worth repeating on new iOS majors: pause a restricted download, turn Low Data Mode on,
then resume — it should stay stalled. Resume goes through
`downloadTask(withResumeData:)`, which carries the policy in undocumented resume data,
so this is the check that catches a silent regression.

### Background Downloads in Tauri Apps

Background downloads work automatically in Tauri apps: when the app resumes, all delegate
callbacks are delivered and state is reconciled.

**Note**: Tauri does not expose the `AppDelegate` hook for
`handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession`, so iOS is never told that background event
processing finished. It may then keep the app running longer than necessary, skip the
app-switcher snapshot, or deprioritize future background execution. Downloads themselves
are unaffected — iOS delivers every pending callback when the app resumes.

If Tauri exposes `AppDelegate` hooks in the future, add:

```swift
import DownloadManagerKit

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession identifier: String,
                 completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {
   DownloadManager.shared.setBackgroundCompletionHandler(completionHandler)
}
```
